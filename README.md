Although we endeavour to ensure that the code TREKIS-3 and results delivered are correct, no warranty is given as to its accuracy. We assume no responsibility for possible errors or omissions. We shall not be liable for any damage arising from the use of this code or its parts or any results produced with it, or from any action or decision taken as a result of using this code or any related material.

This code is distributed as is for non-commercial peaceful purposes only, such as research and education. It is explicitly prohibited to use the code, its parts, its results or any related material for military-related and other than peaceful purposes.
By using this code or its materials, you agree with these terms and conditions.

 *How to cite*

The use of the code is at your own risk. Should you choose to use it, appropriate citations are mandatory:
1)	N. A. Medvedev, R. A. Rymzhanov, A. E. Volkov, J. Phys. D. Appl. Phys. 48 (2015) 355303
